/**
 * Run-time requirements check

 * This function indicates whether the SDK can be used on the current device.
 *
 * It performs a runtime check over the iOS version to prevent using unavailable
 * frameworks and APIs (iOS 4.0 or higher is required at runtime for AVFoundation,
 * multi-tasking and Grand Central Dispatch support).
 *
 * It returns YES if the current device is compatible with the SDK requirements, and
 * NO otherwise.
 *
 * We greatly recommend using this function as soon as possible at runtime and
 * design your application so that it will *NOT* attempt to use the SDK (MSScanner, etc)
 * at all if NO is returned.
